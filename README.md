## Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to try to determine the number of wins that a NBA Basketball team will have during the regular season by analyzing the overall season statistics. This prediction set is used for the current NBA season and no other year statistics would be used. 

When our group decided that we wanted to demonstrate that we could predict overall win/loses based on NBA teams, we realized that any future data used would be challenging for this project. To formulate an appropriate hypothesis, our plan was to use a current year worth of statistics and then to analyze that data and see if our results could be close to what the actual results were. Instead of using previous years data to predict future results, this approach seemed more manageable.

Although actual results would be known for teams wins and losses, our hypothesis is that we can hope to predict season record of individual teams by analyzing statistical data and then compare our results with the actual records. This approached seemed appropriate for the size and scope of the project and allowed us to directly see if our hypothesis was correct or not.   

## Selection of Data
The first challenge of this project was to find quality data to use. Our team went back and fourth on the goal of the project and we knew that we first wanted to find quality to use based off of a rough idea of what we wanted to solve. We decided that we were able to find sports statistical data and moved forward with trying to predict wins/losses based off of our data.  

We collected 3 key pieces of data to help with our projects. We collected 3 comprehensive .csv files including statistics from box scores, team percentages and advanced stats. Projection data will be used from each source of statistics to help us get a better gauge of win percentages.

A challenge with our dataset was to understand what data would be best to overall use to help us make better predictions. Our team also spent significant time understanding the data and what was available to us. Once our team felt comfortable with the dataset and believed we could accomplish our goal, we moved forward with our project.

## Discussion
The most interesting part of this project and something our group discussed in great detail is how we could apply data in this capacity to future seasons. From our dataset, we used previous historic data of the current season to set up a baseline of how we think each team should have done in the standings. In actuality, this approach should be done for future seasons to give predictions based off of unknown statistics. Although the challenge with this is that teams change per year, new players/coaches, and the statistics might not carry over directly.

For future discussions, our team suggested for an improved project and something that would take a lot more time but out of scope of this project would be to analyze years of NBA statistical data and formulate what column data would be more appropriate to further guess outcomes. A lot of the information we used were different offensive/defensive based measurements which seemed to be helpful for this assignment but further rigorous data analysis might show which column data is more impactful. 

## Summary
In summary, our team was able to apply a lot of the techniques we learned this semester into this project and we were happy with our results. It was an interesting exercise to not only chart out statistics but to try to formulate answers based on our data.
