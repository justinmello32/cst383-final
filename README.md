## Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to try to determine the number of wins that a NBA Basketball team will have during the regular season by the season statistics. This prediction set is used for the current NBA season and no other year statistics would be used. Although actual results would be known, our hypothesis is that we will  

## Selection of Data
For this project, we collected 3 key pieces of data to help with our projects. We collected 3 comprehensive .csv files including statistics from box scores, team percentages and advanced stats. Projection data will be used from each source of statistics to help us get a better gauge of win percentages.

## Discussion
The most interesting part of this project and something our group discussed in great detail is how we could apply data in this capacity to future seasons. From our dataset, we used previous historic data of the current season to set up a baseline of how we think each team should have done in the standings. In actuality, this approach should be done for future seasons to give predictions based off of unknown statistics. Although the challenge with this is that teams change per year, new players/coaches, and the statistics might not carry over directly.

For future discussions, our team suggested for an improved project and something that would take a lot more time but out of scope of this project would be to analyze years of NBA statistical data and formulate what column data would be more appropriate to further guess outcomes. A lot of the information we used were different offensive/defensive based measurements which seemed to be helpful for this assignment but further rigorous data analysis migtht show which column data is more impactful. 

## Summary
In summary, our team was able to apply a lot of the techniques we learned this semester into this project and we were happy with our results. It was an interesting exercise to not only chart out statistics but to try to formulate answers based on our data.
